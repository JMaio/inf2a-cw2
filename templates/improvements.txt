1.
attempting to play with the system, it does not seem to accept
semi-complex statements very well.
statements such as
$$  Boo is a brown bear.
        OK.
and when querying for
$$  who is brown?
        Boo
appear to work, however the following cases are misinterpreted:
$$  who is a bear?
        Eh??
$$ who is a brown bear?
        Eh??
$$ which bear is brown?
        Eh??

this could likely be deciphered with an extra function handling
the separation and tagging of the constituents of the statement,
and adding them to the factbase individually.

2.
in addition, when parses are ambiguous, one could likely make
use of, say, the Viterbi algorithm, taking statistics from the
brown corpus which we are already using, as the basis for the
probabilistic determination of the likeliest parse of any given
question, while retaining the original grammar and language
